     <h1>About</h1>
     <h2>Amie Ericson</h2>
     <p>The subject is one of my closest friends so I feel as though I know her very well. I lived with her as a roommate for almost two years, so I love her cat like she was mine and we still visit with each other on at least a monthly basis. She has grown exponentially since first getting to know her. She moved to Athens for a year before discovering other passions and moving back to her home town, where she began working for Starbucks as a part time employee and continuously grew within the company. She collects figurines and Funko Pops in her spare time, of which her most recent acquisition was a pair worth almost $250.</p> 

        <p>Her newest accomplishment was financing a car on her own for the first time as she has become more independent and is able to rely on herself and her job. She wants to continue to grow within the company she works for and continues to grow and flourish as a person on top of that. I will continue to chat with her in person and online about research for this project and I will be checking in with her before finalizing information on the website as I hope she will find some use in it down the road. </p>
        
        <p>Most recently, she is in talks with her manager at work about potentially helping to open a new store. If that store does well, the manager has mentioned that she would like to promote her to assistant manager, which has been a goal of hers ever since she decided she would like to move up in the company. If this information changes before the website is completed I will adjust the information to reflect that too.
